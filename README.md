## Description
This is my 15-112 Final Project.\
This is a 3-player online card game developed using python, with dependency on Professor Saquib Razak's chat server.\
The game rules are identical to those of the famous Chinese card game Dou Di Zhu (斗地主), for more details please check [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dou_dizhu).\
In short, the rules can be summarized as: students rebel their professor and professor oppresses their students, with no hint to Marxism whatsoever.\
The two students are in a team against the one professor in game. Whichever team has a first player that plays all of their handcards win.\
What cards you can play depends on the previous card play. For this part please refer to Wikipedia.
## How to play it?
Ofc the first thing is to familiarize youself with the basic rules of the game.\
Clone this repository, then find two of your friends that are on the chat server to also clone it. Be kind to them if they're not your friend.\
Decide on who's the host of the game, and the other two as participants.\
The host would open and run the ```host.py``` file, and the participants would open and run the ```client.py``` file.\
The host needs to log in to the server with username and password, and then select the names of the other two players to start a game with.\
The other two players simply needs to login with username and password.\
And you've got a chance to be or not to be a professor!
